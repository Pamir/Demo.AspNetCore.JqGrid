# Demo.AspNetCore.JqGrid

This demo application shows how jqGrid can be used in ASP.NET Core (with help of [Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid](https://github.com/tpeczek/Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid)).

As NuGet packages for Lib.AspNetCore.Mvc.JqGrid are not available yet, compiling this project requires downloading and manually referecing the libraries.
